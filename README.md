Design and Simulation of BP Neural Network on MATLAB

<h2>Step by Step Process of writing BP Neural Network on MATLAB</h2>
<p>I have gone through many websites to understand the BP neural network, but I found it challenging to understand. Here is my simple version of the BP network example in MATLAB. A similar process can be written in other programming languages. </p>
<p>For Reference I used the Following Given Parameters</p>
